2,The Music Never Stopped,1 hr. 45 min.,Jim Kohlberg,2011,J.K. Simmons,Cara Seymour,Lou Taylor Pucci,Scott Adsit,James Urbaniak,Max Antisell,65,82,"A wounded and hopeful take on generation gaps and the wider, nearly unbridgeable chasms created by neurological disaster.","A medley of ""Memento,"" ""The King's Speech"" and ""Hair,"" ""The Music Never Stopped"" is sentimental pop packaged as a profound rock opera.","The sentiments are real without succumbing to exaggerated sentimentality, thanks in large part to that big lovable lug, J.K.

There is no comedy relief.,"Pretty Technicolor, but the tearjerking is shameless.","With lovely Greer Garson playing the leading role, the spirit of the story is maintained on a level generally above its frequent insipid spots.","It was a noble deed and a noble effort to make a biography about a woman who was virtually unknown outside Texas, but the picture was long, overly teary, and didn't excite too many people at the box office, although it did make money.","Littered with stilted melodrama, wooden dialogue, and over-the-top courtroom showdowns."

But the flashback format is clumsy and confusing, and the violence veers toward the misogynistic.","We're billboarding this bloodbath because it's stylish, jaw-droppingly funny and features a knockout performance by Ho, who brings to mind the young Deneuve of ""Repulsion.""",Horror fans will be elated with what could be the bravest slasher effort of the last couple years.

Surprisingly, the animated sequences also work quite well.","The graphic violence spatters along for an hour and a half until we reach that point when writer-director James Gunn says, ""That's all I've got"" and basically gives up.","[Not] an easily digestible movie but this is ... the point - in a world where everything isn't as cut and dry as 'good versus evil', rationality is increasingly rare."

This tacky, morally abhorrent film is unbearable.","While Something Borrowed obviously wants to explore themes of competitiveness and betrayal in female friendships, it seems to feel compelled to hit pre-programmed chick flick beats at regular intervals."

But rendering even potentially dramatic stories so inoffensive that they bear no relation to reality makes for middling drama.,"Despite its lapse into melodrama, this faith-based drama is surprisingly effective."
24,Meet Monica Velour,1 hr. 37 min.,Keith Bearden,2011,Kim Cattrall,Dustin Ingram,Brian Dennehy,Jee Young Han,Daniel Yelsky,Keith David,48,34,"Pretty good performance, awfully lame movie.","Had first-time director Keith Bearden been as devoted to keeping Meet Monica Velour on track as he did to coming up with punderful porn flick names, he could have had a satisfying dark comedy on his hands.","The role of a former star of the ''golden age'' of porn sounds perfect for Kim Cattrall, and she handles it nicely - at least, in the rare moments when this indie comedy isn't terminally contrived.",You really come away wishing Cattrall could take this character to a more serious film. Who better to show the flip side of beauty?,"Better than its premise would suggest, the film works to the degree that it does thanks to the well-drawn characterizations and the frequent doses of sly, subtle humor."

That's enough.","Not nearly as much fun as it might have been, neither consistently funny nor remotely scary.","Trollhunter adopts the form of a found footage documentary, which translates as lots of banal conversations, abundant shots of the Scandinavian countryside, and competent but shaky handheld camerawork.","TrollHunter is both creepy and funny, a clever combination for this sly monster movie."

The plot lurches around and the artful structure of Pulp Fiction has been abandoned.,"By the end, Django is a hero for his times: the D is silent, but nothing else is.","Obscurely referential, extremely indulgent, and deliriously over-the-top, Django is -- in other words -- everything you'd expect from a Tarantino joint.","Overlong, self-indulgent garbage with a portrayal of a ""house Negro"" that is a grotesque distortion of a sad reality.","It is plainly a nonstop riot of humor and excitement, and one that matches its delicate nature with an equally calculated sense of importance in leading us to the most satisfying climax possible."

But the film is never truly interesting.","While Caplan works well in theory as an antiromantic-comedy heroine, director and co-screenwriter Michael Mohan just doesn't give her enough to do.","[It] may sound like Sitcomland, but Mr. Mohan's sensibility - visually, comically, in terms of character - is more naturalistic, more Sundance.

(His editing, which often approximates the rhythm of workaday drudgery, is clever without being cutesy.)","It's hardly slick, but that's the selling point. The Happy Poet approaches the ups and downs of friendship, love, work and life with a disposition that is both sardonic and sunny.","This mumblecore entry sometimes sacrifices ambiguity for the sake of broader, telegraphed, one-note laughs.","The smiley ending, most likely meant to be ironic, feels tacked on. But the consistent comic tone of those earlier scenes--a gentle squirm--makes The Happy Poet a promising debut.","A cutting edge social satire about vegetarian pushcart power.

I found it perfectly amiable.","The improbabilities and sheer banality of Christine Bartlett's screenplay are almost overcome by the quality of the cast, but not quite.","The Wedding Party may well have been a better film if the underdone premise of the fake wedding had been done away with altogether, because the movie is more interesting when it picks at the foibles and fears that gather around these couples."

Instead, he puts most of his efforts into creating a believable dynamic between the father and his sons, and it's in this tangled skein of shyness, suspicion, loyalty and love that the film's heart lies."

He's the kind of performer who doesn't have to work hard to win over an audience; he is instantly likable. In a movie like this, that's money in the bank.",This entertaining crossover vehicle for Mexican star Jaime Camil sets a familiar love story to a mariachi beat.,"Serving mostly as a strong calling card for star Jaime Camil, the film has an appealingly loose, slightly ramshackle charm.","This bilingual romantic comedy is overly long and has a paper-thin plot, but it's too sweet-natured to dislike.",Sweet subtitled romcom hinges on night of drinking.

It's a gimmicky sitcom script gussied up with 'artful' affectations borrowed from the New Hollywood heyday of the early '70s.,"There are insights into old age, pearls of wisdom and gags galore, all wrapped up in a coating that's more akin to a bitter lemon than sugar.","It's a surprising performance from Forte, tasked with much of the heavy lifting opposite a tight-lipped Dern."

The lack of continuity only enhances the sense of deliciously dizzying disequilibrium.,"As philosophy, Mr. Nobody seems sillier than it is profound. But in a parallel reality, more movies would have this degree of insane ambition.",This big-budget English-language co-production shows that Europeans can compete in the sci-fi realm where high production values are king.,"While Mr. Nobody contains some truly moving scenes, it eventually starts to try your concentration when you suspect all the space/time continuum shuffling may never become more than the sum of its parts.","[Writer-director] Van Dormael seems unsure of what exactly it is he's trying to say, and thus Mr. Nobody rambles on for nearly two and a half hours."

But Tom Hardy is so compelling, multilayered and terrific in the title role, this one-man show is never dull.","As you'd expect from a story that never leaves the confines of a car, Locke is intense and claustrophobic.",Tom Hardy's visceral performance in this one-man meltdown packs more drama than a half-dozen multi-character stories.,"The fact that Locke delivers, then, is splendid news, especially for fans of onscreen minimalism and alternative approaches to familiar stories."

Perhaps that's why Frankie & Alice plays more like an elaborate acting workshop than a movie.","While all this channel-switching and inevitable unearthing of psychic demons generates a great awards-season clip, it doesn't necessarily lead to a satisfying drama.","It may be that this genre has been forever ruined, or just that it requires a more subtle hand than the one exhibited by Geoffrey Sax, the director here.","Lamentably by-the-numbers, treated like an affliction-of-the-week TV movie by its eight (!) credited writers and directed by Geoffrey Sax as if he knew where commercials should go."

He only maintains viewer sympathy because everyone else in the film is so obnoxious.","It manages to make an entertaining story out of nothing in particular. And just when you get comfortable passively observing a passive observer, the minutest of twists becomes its own call to action.","The cheerful Dixieland soundtrack implies ""A Coffee in Berlin"" is a comedy, but the story line smears the screen with melancholy.",As sure of itself visually in its black-and-white evocations of Berlin as its protagonist is unsure of himself and his future.

2359,Begin Again,1 hr. 41 min.,John Carney,2014,Keira Knightley,Mark Ruffalo,Hailee Steinfeld,Adam Levine,Catherine Keener,James Corden,83,81,The trouble with this movie -- aside from its lack of visual wonder and musical shape -- is that you don't trust its priorities.,"Begin Again is a delight, not only because of its infectious musical vitality but because it follows the unexpected forks in the road.","It's not nearly as good as ""Once"" but still very charming and entertaining.","Gretta's own songs aren't the type to grab you by the throat, but performed with soulful sweetness by Knightley they slowly sink their hooks into you, just like the film itself.","This movie is inspired by the success of the film 'Once', written and directed by John Carney. Carney's new movie has a similar story, but this time, with more money, better music and actors, he's made a better film."

It never hits a false note.","The chronicle of a less self-absorbed generation, it's less annoying than The Big Chill but also less funny.",Only Plaza's performance as the troubled Sarah comes close to creating a three-dimensional character.,The insight that social media fosters false intimacy is old news.

Namely, that war is hell. Message received.","Pitt, who at 50 still looks great with his shirt off, has the gruff charisma to play a dauntless soldier with killer courage and a vestigial streak of humanity.","It's an ""unflinching"" account of war -- ""unflinching,"" in quotes, because every moment of the film is composed to grind your face into the muck and be proud of itself for doing so.","Pitt is at the top of his game, playing a man who has forgotten whatever he used to be and has wholly embraced his role in this war."

There is a clear conflict between the pastor and the town, but there's no good vs. evil.","So much of ""The Overnighters"" tells all sorts of truths, and Moss earned the trust of his subjects, whatever they might think of the result.","The movie might seem like just another liberal do-gooder profile, yet a shocker ending throws new and disturbing light on the situation, amplifying the Christian themes at the heart of the story."

2691,Black Sea,1 hr. 55 min.,Kevin Macdonald,2015,Jude Law,Scoot McNairy,Ben Mendelsohn,David Threlfall,Karl Davies,Jodie Whittaker,81,60,Cliches abound in this waterlogged post-Cold War thriller from director Kevin Macdonald.,"Director Kevin Macdonald successfully ties the psychological tension with the physical, using the tight confines of a submarine setting rather masterfully, squeezing each drop of tension and expertly pacing every plot twist in Dennis Kelly's screenplay.","With stunning underwater visuals, and a story that is engaging enough despite its obvious turns, there may be gold here yet.","The plot doesn't entirely hold water... but Law exudes brawny charisma and helps the film build up a good head of sweaty, claustrophobic tension.","Black Sea is another strongly made drama from British filmmaker Kevin Macdonald and, like The Last King of Scotland and State of Play, is about a protagonist in an untenable situation."
2692,La religieuse (The Nun),1 hr. 54 min.,Guillaume Nicloux,2013,Pauline Etienne,Isabelle Huppert,Louise Bourgoin,Martina Gedeck,Françoise Lebrun,Agathe Bonitzer,75,54,"Measured and sensible, The Nun lacks the full-on claustrophobic horror of a film like The Magdalene Sisters and moves through events at a matter-of-fact distance.","Pauline Etienne as the heroine is a harmonising centre, believable, luminous, quiet-spoken, poignant.","It's an affecting and frank take on the loneliness of faith as well as faithlessness, whose horrors come in odd contrast to the plush production values.",It's a generally classy yet dramatically underpowered affair traversing a steady path between respectable costume drama and habit-lifting exploitation.,"Looks as tasteful as can be but, in terms of emotion, lacks any kind of finesse."
2693,My Mistress,1 hr. 44 min.,Stephen Lance,2014,Emmanuelle Béart,Harrison Gilbertson,Hugh Parker,Rachael Blake,Socratis Otto,,33,34,"The fact that My Mistress looks out of place, set as it is in suburban Queensland, doesn't detract from the director's ambition and obvious promise.","Debut director Stephen Lance makes it all look pretty enough, but the film is so staid, safe and polite it's often just plain dull. If only the film had a real taste for the transgressions it gingerly depicts, it could have been Australia's Blue Velvet.","While it's good that Lance eschews the conventional, the question becomes, what does he have in its place? I was left unsure of the answer.","In the story of Kate's fractured relationship with her son is a tough and potentially tender film, but Beart and her pout get in the way.",Most of the problems in My Mistress stem from the fact that it is steeped in cliché.
2694,The Last 5 Years,1 hr. 34 min.,Richard LaGravenese,2015,Anna Kendrick,Jeremy Jordan,Meg Hudson,Natalie Knepp,Nic Novicki,,60,59,"Anna Kendrick, of all-round-awesome fame, is singing again in this adaptation of an off-Broadway musical.","It doesn't help that the songs, while solid, become repetitive in melody. And there's not a home run in the bunch. I walked out humming ... nothing from this movie.","Richard LaGravenese's adaptation of Jason Robert Brown's The Last Five Years presents an intriguing and compelling spin on the standard musical, and on storytelling in general.","It's a film to bring tears to the eyes of a cynic - in fact, a cynic might relish it more than anyone, since it's the counterpointing of exuberance with unashamed bleakness that makes The Last Five Years so rich.","A musical lives or dies based on the quality of its songs, and though The Last Five Years delivers some solid tunes none of them are earworms that'll stay with you beyond the closing credits."
2695,Brush With Danger,1 hr. 30 min.,Livi Zheng,2014,Livi Zheng,Ken Zheng,Norman Newkirk,Nikita Breznikov,Michael Blend,Stephanie Hilbert,20,80,"Though not entirely an original concept, this vibrantly shot, East-meets-West fusion of Wushu and Washington never feels like a cheap forgery.","Although the characters repeatedly express their worship of ""original art"" in gilded frames, the script consists of singularly unoriginal dialogue.","Brush With Danger's few action scenes, all poorly choreographed, do nothing to extenuate the film's offensive characterizations.","There's precious little here that hasn't been done better before, at least when it comes to the martial beatdowns.",Brush with Danger appears to mean well...But the movie's laudable message is undermined by some terrible acting.

2700,The Sleepwalker,1 hr. 32 min.,Mona Fastvold,2014,Gitte Witt,Christopher Abbott,Stephanie Ellis,Brady Corbet,,,50,31,"The setup has mysterious promise, but the film cheaps out on a satisfying payoff.","With strong assists from the cinematographer Zachary Galler and her ex-husband, the composer Sondre Lerche, Ms. Fastvold, previously a director of music videos, has painted a resonant tableau of dysfunction.","Among the many unanswered questions, I ask: Where do they find this junk, and where do so many amateurs get the money to finance it?","The Sleepwalker distinguishes itself from most entries in this angst-ridden genre by way of superb writing, smoldering performances, and hauntingly beautiful imagery from first-time director Mona Fastvold.","None of the characters is particularly likable or admirable, leaving little opportunity for sympathy or curiosity to penetrate the constantly heightened air of psychodrama."

The former ""Friends"" star clearly wanted something special, but sadly the result is ... this.","Courteney Cox's directorial debut ""Just Before I Go"" is a ""Garden State"" retread in which filthy jokes gradually cede ground to sentimental slush.",A serious misfire.
2703,Two Men in Town,2 hr.,Rachid Bouchareb,2015,Forest Whitaker,Brenda Blethyn,Harvey Keitel,Ellen Burstyn,Luis Guzman,Dolores Heredia,44,27,"It'll be easy for some to dismiss this as a familiar story told all too coolly, but look closer and you'll see it has a raging heart.","The desert landscapes are gorgeously shot by Yves Cape, but ""Two Men in Town"" never seems to fully inhabit its setting. Nor does the schematic, occasionally clumsy story do justice to the skills of the cast.","The setting is striking, the cast impressive. But ""Two Men in Town,"" a drama that's built on dread and circles the question of redemption for a newly released prisoner, falls short of the mythic territory it aspires to.","The movie's melancholic, atmospheric tone, coupled with a muted performance from Whitaker, offers a new way into the material.","Even if the accents are questionable or inconsistent, there's still a sense of place and geography that's rare in contemporary American film. This is the county-sized world of a parolee, where everything seems small except the horizon."
2704,Beloved Sisters,2 hr. 50 min.,Dominik Graf,2015,Hannah Herzsprung,Florian Stetter,Henriette Confurius,Claudia Messner,Ronald Zehrfeld,Maja Maranow,74,43,"It's epic stuff, and at 170 minutes it's a commitment. Schiller seems to be blazing a trail for German über-confidence, seeing his modern man as the grand product of all that's been right with history.","If nothing else, ""Beloved Sisters"" is one of the most visually striking biopics around. Too bad you have to wade through so much verbiage in order to enjoy it.","Without at least the tawdry pleasure of a little bodice ripping, the film moves along sluggishly, even though it is well acted and handsomely shot.","When an occasional blast of purple dialogue is triggered (such as ''Save me from my passion!''), it only makes you wish for the unintellectual bodice ripper that the movie should have been.","If more historical movies were like Beloved Sisters, the term ""costume drama"" would be less of an insult."
2705,Still Alice,1 hr. 39 min.,Richard Glatzer,2015,Julianne Moore,Alec Baldwin,Kristen Stewart,Kate Bosworth,Hunter Parrish,Shane McRae,88,85,"While Still Alice occasionally overstates, relies on its melancholy soundtrack or those home movie-style flashbacks, it can also be delicate, even brilliant.","Despite Moore's fine work, Still Alice comes across as one of those old made-for-TV, disease of the week movies.","Still Alice is not an easy film to watch, but it is a movie well worth seeing.","More sincere than convincing, Still Alice is the rare picture that earns plaudits for its star dimming, not glowing. In a real sense, Moore gradually disappears from her own movie.",It does have a predictable trajectory -- how could it not? -- but it's certainly not movie-of-the-week fare.
2706,Blackhat,2 hr. 13 min.,Michael Mann,2015,Chris Hemsworth,Viola Davis,Tang Wei,Leehom Wang,Holt McCallany,Ritchie Coster,34,25,It's still no return to form for Mann after the disappointing Miami Vice and Public Enemies.,Blackhat feels like the vehicle that Mann wanted to explore the hacking world but the casting and the script's counterintuitive motivations it mutated away from his intent. It's a shame.,Get over the shock of seeing Chris Hemsworth as a keyboard-clicking computer hacker rather than a hammer-heaving Marvel hero and Michael Mann's stylish cyber thriller Blackhat will soon have you gripped and intrigued.,"Such a deranged, half-kidding symphony of color, movement and sheer cinematic muscle, I spent most of the running time trying to pick my jaw up off the floor.",This is visionary filmmaking of the first order.
2707,The Immortalists,1 hr. 28 min.,David Alvarado,2014,Bill Andrews,Aubrey de Grey,,,,,70,70,"The age-old search for the fountain of youth is engagingly appraised in ""The Immortalists,"" a lively documentary focusing on a pair of very different biomedical scientists who are equally obsessed with eradicating the ravages of time.","This sly documentary rises above its speculative hook by shifting to show the very human, and very mortal, sides of these would-be warriors of eternity.","Should you find the prospect of immortality terrifying, as I do, the film has a vast philosophical hole at its center, and passes with only occasional spikes of interest.",Would that the film encouraged some deeper thought on the matter instead of inviting viewers to gawk at the subjects as if they were freak-show attractions.,"Even if it doesn't convince us they're likely to conquer death before it comes for them, the film does prompt interesting debates about just how desirable an unlimited stay on Planet Earth would be."
2708,The Living,1 hr. 29 min.,Jack Bryan,2015,Fran Kranz,Jocelin Donahue,Kenny Wormald,Chris Mulkey,Joelle Carter,,43,37,"""The Living"" presents itself as a searing genre piece about domestic violence, but it proves to be only a shell of its potential.",An effective modern day noir.,"The emotional dynamics in domestic violence, for the abuser and the abused, are often too disturbing and complex to be treated as superficially as ""The Living"" does.","The Living could be something kind of interesting, if only it weren't trying so hard to emotionally goad its audience.",The Living is one of those unfortunate films ignorant of any world outside its author's head.
2709,The Blue Room,1 hr. 16 min.,Mathieu Amalric,2014,Léa Drucker,Mathieu Amalric,Stéphanie Cléau,Laurent Poitrenaux,Blutch,Serge Bozon,86,51,The ultimate triumph in what Amalric has done is to show us all the different forces that can be at work in an affair.,A dazzling deconstruction of the mystery genre that turns its conventions on their heads.,"'The Blue Room"" is a tight little look at love gone wrong, something of a stripped-down French ""Gone Girl"" without the surprises.","It's an accomplished film, if a bit cool and tidy; you wish there were a little more to it.","The pleasure of a whodunit generally derives from trying to figure out who done it, but in the case of this arty, terminally obscure French mystery, most of the story has already transpired before one can even piece together what was done."

But overall, his sensitive, moody camerawork and the cast's strong performances go a long way toward making the familiar feel fresh.","Johnson unquestionably has his heart in the right place, but he's made a commonplace film built around one of those too-fragile-for-this-world teens who can be traced directly back to Timothy Hutton in Ordinary People."

Girlhood follows a trajectory of transformation, something that Toure achieves with effortless fluidity.","Very good, very punchy social drama from France about Marieme (Karidja Toure), a prospectless, poverty-stricken black French teenage girl who succumbs to the ego-boosting allure of being in a gang.",...has wonderful moments in which the carefree nature of childhood is held in bittersweet tension with the yearning to be an adult.,"[From] urgent, fast-moving cinematography, intense close-ups. . . and percussive soundtrack. . . to cautionary tale of the limits of being a young black female in France."

The cool gray dawns and barren landscapes express Kolya's despair and isolation.,"Leviathan is a hoot, a tragedy and a masterpiece.","How can a bleak film be dazzling? It can, when you think about it.",Zvyagintsev literally and allegorically depicts modern Russia's runaway corruption but also captures universal fears about the shaky ground on which we construct our lives. [Blu-ray],"Despite having slight issues with an overlong runtime and a narrative that downshifts in the second half, Leviathan manages to power through with a compelling story and a beautifully-crafted look."

And in a film about a burnout bonding with a cute kid, that lack of self-awareness proves critical.","Throughout the movie, you have the feeling of being dragged along on an impromptu journey by a filmmaker who is traveling without the benefit of a GPS device."

It's a male fantasy, and a cautionary tale. It's sleazy in concept, and timid in execution. It punishes its protagonists for their transgressions, then lets them off the hook.","There's no redeeming this softcore nonsense, which plays like a script that Storage Wars stumbled across in Joe Eszterhas's old locker.","The twisty plot translates to any culture where swinging-d--- businessmen cheat on their wives -- which is to say, any culture."

2905,Capital C,1 hr. 27 min.,Jørg Kundinger,2015,Brian Fargo,Zach Crain,Jack Robinson,Jackson Robinson,,,0,75,"Interviewees allude to unfunded and failed projects, as well as exploitation by scam artists, which Kundinger and Birkhofer should have investigated further.",Thin but inspirational.,Very effectively shows both the upside of crowdfunding and the struggles of making good on a successful campaign.,,
2906,Hungry Hearts,1 hr. 49 min.,Saverio Costanzo,2015,Adam Driver,Alba Rohrwacher,Roberta Maxwell,Al Roffe,Jason Selvig,Geisha Otero,61,49,"Rohrwacher, meanwhile, is superb as Mina, in a role that couldn't be drawn less sympathetically.","A strange, harrowing, often remarkable story of love and obsession.","Hungry Hearts is a troubled, troubling movie. The unrest it creates looms long after the end credits have rolled.","A robust thriller with a questionable, although intriguing, commentary on motherhood and mental illness.",Mr. Costanzo's attempt at rendering the fraying of minds and marital bonds draws on notions of hysteria that only shortchange his characters.
2907,Paper Towns,1 hr. 49 min.,Jake Schreier,2015,Nat Wolff,Cara Delevingne,Halston Sage,Austin Abrams,Justice Jesse Smith,Justice Smith,55,53,"Paper Towns is particularly good at pinpointing that certain point in teenage male friendships where the guys are getting older, but they still sometimes resort to silly voices and goofy humor when the girls aren't around.","After setting the scene with vivid characters and some insightful interaction, the plot of this teen comedy-drama feels like a let down.","This movie's relationship to teen-romance--flirting with it, undercutting it, swooning back into its clichéd thrall--is frustrating and intriguing in spurts. By the end, it's more like it's-a-wrap than the messy, crumpled-up drafts of life.",Delevingne is plain. The soundtrack is flat and bland. The film photography satisfy but does not provide. Cinematically is average with the usual voiceover that solves all kinds of problems. [Full review in Spanish],"Almost in spite of itself, succeeds in saying something interesting about its teen audience before ultimately revealing itself to be entirely vacuous after all."
2908,Testament Of Youth,2 hr. 9 min.,James Kent,2015,Alicia Vikander,Kit Harington,Dominic West,Emily Watson,Hayley Atwell,Taron Egerton,81,79,"Somehow, Vikander sells it all, not with braying and big gestures, but with vulnerability, sincerity and the sort of ethereal realness that can't be quantified. More, please, more.","Though the movie at times feels oddly unfinished (you wonder what Miranda Richardson, in a tiny role as an Oxford professor, is there for), it's artful and moving.","As a story, it evokes a word that no battlefield nurse would ever apply to her experiences: sterile.",Testament of Youth isn't a typical biopic; it's a heartfelt manual on forging ahead.,"Beneath all that genre eye candy, though, resides a smart and moving story that, after a somewhat slow-moving first hour, builds nicely to become an emotionally engaging drama."
2909,Sunset Edge,1 hr. 27 min.,Daniel Peddle,2015,Jacob Kristian Ingle,William Dickerson,Gilberto Padilla,Blaine Edward Pugh,Haley McKnight,Jack Tin Horn,67,100,"Sunset Edge has a visually poetic quality that goes a long way towards compensating for its opaquely nonlinear, barely there narrative.",Full of striking images but badly overestimates the entertainment value of abandoned trailer parks for the average moviegoer.,A densely atmospheric portrait of disaffected youth by artist-filmmaker Daniel Peddle that flouts preconceived notions at every unconventional turn.,As uninterested in examining its chosen milieu as it is in fashioning anything approaching an engaging narrative.,The one thing that's lacking? A payoff. [But] director Daniel Peddle gets great performances from his non-professional cast and expertly builds a taut and disturbing atmosphere.
2910,Southpaw,2 hr. 3 min.,Antoine Fuqua,2015,Jake Gyllenhaal,Forest Whitaker,Rachel McAdams,Naomie Harris,Víctor Ortíz,50 Cent,59,79,Southpaw has that inevitability factor .... it's tough to support a two-hour film when its course seems predetermined and it hits every familiar beat along the way.,"If you don't know how Southpaw is going to end, then this is the first movie you've ever seen and you should have started with a better one.","Though much has been made of the physical transformation Jake Gyllenhaal put himself through to look like a real boxer, Southpaw is a fairly standard, by-the-numbers boxing melodrama that hits all those beats we're accustomed to through the Rocky films.","Fuqua's film is an enjoyable enough by-the-numbers drama, with good work from Jake, Rachel and young Laurence and enough heart to keep you interested, no matter how thumpingly familiar it tends to feel.",A conventional movie that stands out thanks to Gyllenhaal's performance. [Full review in Spanish]
2911,Pixels,1 hr. 46 min.,Chris Columbus,2015,Adam Sandler,Peter Dinklage,Kevin James,Michelle Monaghan,Jane Krakowski,Josh Gad,17,51,"Pixels is devoid of cynicism and it has a cheerfully cheesy vibe, and it's the kind of movie you'll forget about a week after seeing it.","Coming up short in terms of both humour and story, Pixels runs out of lives well before the closing credits.","Pixels calms down and doesn't contain a lot of internal logic, but with Monaghan and Dinklage to do the heavy lifting, it manages to stay afloat.","Overlong, overcooked, overextended and over-everythinged but never amusing.","Pixels' predecessors, such as Ghostbusters, had an irreverent disrespect for authority and a deadpan outlook, but few of the many elements here are developed beyond the rudimentary."
2912,Tu Dors Nicole,1 hr. 33 min.,Stéphane Lafleur,2015,Julianne Côté,Juliette Gosselin,Marc-Andre Grondin,Francis La Haye,Simon Larouche,Catherine St-Laurent,100,66,"Lafleur's film is a quiet trifle that sneaks up on you, like a pleasant dream you might have and then gradually forget. Its very slightness is its greatest weapon.","Martin is as desperate to grow up as Nicole is reluctant to take the next step. Both are at a crossroads that this wonderful, lighter-than-air movie depicts as a major turning point.",Director Stéphane Lafleur shoots in black and white with a sure and delicate eye.,"The night scenes are particularly resonant, mixing humour, suspense and textured visuals. This is the kind of film dream from which you feel reluctant to wake.","Tu Dors Nicole accurately recreates that feeling of youth when the summer seemed like it would last forever. As the French say, it's très drôle."
2913,The Making Of A Lady,1 hr. 36 min.,Richard Curson Smith,2014,Lydia Wilson,Linus Roache,James D'Arcy,Hasina Haque,Joanna Lumley,Maggie Fox,0,43,"The intent of the production is clear, but the execution is hopelessly mangled, leaving a picture that commences with dignity and concludes as an absolute mess.",,,,
